from Engine.object import Item

office_keycard = Item("Office Keycard",
                      "A sleek, blue-tinted keycard meant for office access. An embossed name catches your eye; it tickles the back of your mind, feeling oddly familiar, but you can't pinpoint why.")

spaceship_keycard = Item("Spaceship Keycard",
                         "This glossy black card feels alien in your hand. Symbols on it hint at access to a spaceport. A number sequence, perhaps corresponding to a specific spaceship, is prominently displayed.")

crowbar = Item("Crowbar",
               "A solid, slightly rusted crowbar. Its heft feels reassuring. An indispensable tool if you need to pry something open or perhaps gain unauthorised entry into a building.")

military_keycard = Item("Military Base Keycard",
                        "A keycard with a stern, militaristic design. Its surface is covered in cryptic codes and insignias, but one emblem stands outâ€”a depiction of Mars. Could this lead to a base on the Red Planet?")

labs_keycard = Item("LABS Skeleton Keycard",
                    "This keycard has a ghostly white hue and bears the emblem of 'Forget Inc.' LABS. Universal access, it seems. Memories of a shadowy laboratory on Earth prickle your thoughts.")

robot_remote = Item("Robot Remote",
                    "A complicated-looking remote packed with myriad buttons. Amid the confusion, one button is unmistakably labelled 'Deactivate'. A potential lifeline when faced with menacing security robots.")

memory_extractor = Item("Memory Extractor",
                        "A device that seems to give the user the ability to extract and thus forget memories.")
