Everything in the world is an interactable. You can (potentially):
If you make everything have a default negative value, you only have to script whatever is possible in that situation.

Locations have three parts:
    - A description of the location
    - A description of sublocations/objects of interest
    - Items

The game starts with all locations loaded fresh, and we begin at the first location.
The game state changes when we move locations or interact with the objects/items


The game engine does the following things:

- Change the header to the location we are at
- Give a description of the location
- List the objects
- List the items that are here
- List of actions to be taken:
    - Item:
        - Inspect it
        - Take it
        - Use it
    - Object:
        - Inspect it (Change the description or state depending on situation)
        - Interact with it (give the player a hint an item can be used if needed)
        - Use Item on it (Change its state)
    - Exits (to adjacent locations):
        - Enter it (if open)
        - Open it (with item if needed)
- A message about the last action taken
- Takes user input/command as text
    - Redraws screen
    - Takes input


Things to do:
- Create Item with commands from above
- Create Object with commands from above
- Create Exit with commands from above
- Create a test location with two objects and two items and two exits
- Create a UI that can display the above and ask for input
- Create interactions with the items, objects and exits by converting the input to commands/function calls

Things to think about:
- Whenever objects can change states, we define those variables and use them as condition checkers for the state of the object
    - So if we have a button on an object, the INTERACT will depend on the state of that variable
