# EARTH
- Location: House, the house of the player
    - POI: Window, looking through it, it's strange that nobody seems to be outside. Normally busy in this town.
    - POI: Television, it's off and won't turn on.
    - POI: Table, there is spoiled food on it and a piece of paper that talks about an attack on Mars
    - POI: Desk, a strange letter that seems to indicate that the reader should not try to understand what is going on, but use the precious time left to enjoy life as much as you can.
- Location: Laboratory, it's unclear what the purpose is of this laboratory. It's kind of secretive, dark tinted windows, etc.
    - POI: Memory Extractor, this is the last POI the player will see. They will understand what is going on in the world (big solar flare, society collapsed) and choose to remove their memories like they did the last time (and wrote that letter to themselves on the desk)
- Location: Office, some office like many others, a name is shown above the door. The front door is wide open, seems like some damage is done to the building.
    - POI: Reception desk, seems like the person there left in a hurry. Describe some things laying around that would fit here. Maybe refer to the dead electronics again.
    - POI: Office rooms, Player will see a lot of office rooms, but one has a name that feels familiar. In that room they find a keycard, seemingly for access to the spaceport.
- Location: Spaceport, seems to be filled with broken and destroyed ships. One of them might be in working order, but we'd need to check. Describe it as if fighting happened around here.
    - POI: Personal Spaceship, the player doesn't know it, but this is their personal spaceship. The number on the spaceship keycard corresponds with the number on the outside of the ship.
    - POI: Crashed spaceship, seems like the crew hasn't survived the landing. Maybe add some details to the description.
    - POI: Transport spaceship, the main point is that it's looted, add details.

# MOON
- Location: Spaceport, like the previous spaceport, but on the moon instead of on earth. When you land, you can see a giant dome above you covering the small outpost where we landed.
    - POI: Empty spaceship, in the cabin you find a note telling any loved ones to stop looking for the person writing it. They tell how they lost everything to looters.
    - POI: Spaceport Utilities center, a place where one would go for ship repairs or to buy tools or spaceship parts
- Location: Moon viewing platform, a platform at the edge of town to enjoy the view across the barren moon landscape. Above the horizon, pure blackness of the galaxy and some stars.
    - POI: Loving couple, the remains of two people holding hands on a bench. Not much is left beside bones. Most of their skeletons collapsed, but their hands remain together.
    - POI: Moon view, a description of the empty space and how all of a sudden it's not much different from the places we've visited. Everyone seems to be either gone or dead.
- Location: Cafe Ditin, a not-so-fancy bar where the working class people from the spaceport would come for a drink after work. It's completely empty, besides a few skeletons around the room.
    - POI: Tables, one of the tables has three skeletons seated on chairs (if they didn't completely collapse). On the table are four empty glasses, one chair is empty, without a skeleton. A business card, with the same name the player saw in the office room is found on the table.
    - POI: Bar, Empty glasses on the bar, bottles are gone or smashed to pieces, behind the bar is a large mirror. The player notices that they have a partially healed wound on their forehead.
    - POI: Backdoor, the player notices the backdoor is open. When they go look they see a dead soldier sitting next to the door, overlooking the empty moon landscape, with the earth above the horizon.

# MARS
- Location: Spaceport, another spaceport, this time on mars. The ships are made for warfare. The fighting here was heavier than in other places. A lot of buildings are destroyed.
    - POI: Empty warship, Impressive and armament. It seems impossible to enter. Create some details of the damage to the ship.
    - POI: Destroyed buildings. Several destroyed buildings surround the spaceport. Seems like a large fight took place here. Give a summary of the type of buildings that could be destroyed and damaged at a sci-fi military base on Mars.
- Location: Forget Inc, a corporation with a secretive purpose. The player has always been curious about them and the front door is open... If it weren't for the big military robot defending the entrance, we might be able to enter it.
    - POI: Conference room, on the large table in the room some documents for a presentation can be found. They talk about a project to remove memories, as to resolve the problem of PTSD in soldiers.
    - POI: Forget Labs, many machines can be found, all of them destroyed. A man lies dead on the floor. After further investigation it seems to be the CEO and his keycard is hanging from his neck.
- Location: Military Base, It looks like a lot of fighting took place here, but we are still able to enter the building. Many dead soldiers lay around.
    - POI: Military Research Center, on a table the player finds a report of the many successful memory removals they have performed on soldiers. The report concludes that the process works, but memories may return in some circumstances.
    - POI: Command center, Completely empty besides the many screens hanging on the wall. Documents can be found telling about a great war that started after the solar flares destroyed most electronics.
    - POI: Robot center, what at first looks to be a datacenter is rather a workshop area where guard robots are made. There don't seem to be any robots here, but a device looking like a remote is found.


# ITEMS
- Item: Office Keycard, a keycard which seems to be for an office worker. The name written on it seems familiar, but the player doesn't know why.
- Item: Spaceship keycard, a keycard that seems to give access to a spaceport and a spaceship registered to it.
- Item: Crowbar, nothing special about it, but a handy tool to break into a building.
- Item: Military Base Keycard, a keycard that gives access to a military base, maybe if we take a better look at it we can see where this base is; Mars.
- Item: LABS Skeleton Keycard, a keycard that seems to give access to all Forget Inc. buildings. Wasn't there a strange laboratory on earth?
- Item: Robot Remote, has a lot of buttons, but the button called "deactivate" might come in handy for any security robots we might encounter.
